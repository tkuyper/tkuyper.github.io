<h1>First Impressions of AngularJS</h1>

<h5>2016-02-24</h5>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it took me a little bit to get my head around <a href="http://angularjs.org">AngularJS</a> at first, it seems like a very powerful tool in creating single page applications.
From what I understand so far, the AngularJS framework lets you set up a Model/View/Controller in Javascript to run an entire application on the client side which then interacts with your server using AJAX.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AngularJS saves bandwidth (especially important on mobile devices) by having the entire application downloaded once and run from cache in the future.
Given that you are running scripts to concatenate and minify your CSS files and Javascript to create your production distribution, nearly the entire application is downloaded on first page load.
The only bandwidth you may use after that is to download some HTML files for your views, and any api calls you may have to make to retrieve and save information to the server.
All this of course requires the client have Javascript enabled, but this a requirement for many modern websites.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of my favorite aspects is the fact that it can completely separate the backend from the frontend.
I've done many web applications as part of my job with <a href="http://www.catalystframework.org">Perl Catalyst</a> and <a href="http://template-toolkit.org">Template Toolkit</a>.
These tools are fantastic but require logic on the server that determines what template is rendered, what variables are passed to the template, etc.
The server serving pages to clients has been the standard for many years, but (most) clients are fast in this day and age.
We have the available computing power in the first world to have clients run applications on their own machines and only interact with the server when they need to.
This also has the upside of letting power users use browser extensions like <a href="http://www.greasespot.net">Greasemonkey</a> to extend applications if they choose.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, I'm very excited to be learning AngularJS. I feel like it will quickly become one of my favorite Javascript frameworks.</p>
